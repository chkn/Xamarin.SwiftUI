	/// A base class used to implement a Swift struct as a reference type.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// It is possible to bind a Swift struct as a managed value type, but this
	///  is only safe in the case of POD types. Otherwise, we need to ensure that
	///  ownership is handled correctly, which we can only do reliably with a
	///  class that is finalizable, such as this one.
	/// <para/>
	/// There are other cases where Swift structs must be reflected as a managed class,
	///  such as when dealing with generic Swift structs that are not statically sized,
	///  when fields must be exposed in Swift metadata, or when the Swift struct is
	///  non-movable (<see cref="ValueWitnessTable.IsNonBitwiseTakable"/>).
	/// <para/>
	/// An instance of this class can own a single copy of the Swift struct data, but other
	///  copies may be created when passing the value to Swift. It is also possible for an
	///  instance of this class to not own its own data. This happens when the instance
	///  represents a field in a larger struct. In that case, the <see cref="SwiftStruct"/>
	///  instance representing the outer struct owns the data.
	/// <para/>
	/// When an instance of this class does own its data, the data is deinitialized and
	///  deallocated when this instance is disposed or finalized.
	/// </remarks>

# Xamarin.SwiftUI

A managed binding to SwiftUI.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Xamarin toolchain
- Xcode 11 or newer
- Xcode [command line](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html) tools

### Build Everything and NuGet Package

```
msbuild build.proj
```

If you need to make changes to the SwiftUIGlue native glue library during development, you can rebuild just those bits by running:

```
msbuild build.proj /t:SwiftUIGlue /p:Configuration=Debug
```

### Visual Studio for Mac

Open `Xamarin.SwiftUI.sln`

For more information about the internals and guidance on developing the binding itself, see the document titled [Hacking](Hacking.md).

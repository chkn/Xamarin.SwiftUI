## Project Status:
âœ… **Active**.

Xamarin.SwiftUI provides a managed binding to Apple's next-generation [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) toolkit. Using your favourite .NET language, you should be able to create SwiftUI apps. However, only a handful of APIs are currently bound. [Work is ongoing](https://github.com/chkn/Xamarin.SwiftUI/tree/swift-parser2) on a binding generator to automatically cover the entire API surface.

## Example

A simple custom view with state:

```csharp
using SwiftUI;
using static SwiftUI.Views;

public partial record ClickView : View
{
	readonly State<int> clicks = new State<int> (0);
	public View Body
		=> Button ($"Clicked {clicks.Value} times", () => clicks.Value++);
}
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6 SDK
- Xcode 13 or newer

### Building

```
dotnet msbuild /restore build.proj
```

If you need to make changes to the SwiftUIGlue native glue library during development, you can rebuild just those bits by running:

```
dotnet msbuild build.proj /t:SwiftUIGlue
```

#### Packaging

The major and minor version of nuget packages created by the CI pipeline is controlled by the `VERSION` file. This does not need to be bumped for patch releases.

For local development, the version of the package produced can be overridden:

```
dotnet msbuild /restore build.proj /t:Pack /p:Version=X.X.XXX
```
